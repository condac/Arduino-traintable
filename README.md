Arduino-traintable
==================

!! NOTE !! Check out my other project for a more usefull traincontroller https://github.com/condac/DCC-SAAC 

Automatic DCC controler with Arduino for a small coffe table layout


This program controls 2 trains and make them stop at a station or other stop when the train passes a sensor. 
Its made to run 2 trains on diffrent loops but with the same dcc track power. 

There is also a switch to take manual control of both train. And a stop/start switch, when turning off the trains will find the stop sensor and park there. After both train park track power is shut off.
